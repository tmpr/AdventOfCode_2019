# AdventOfCode_2019

As I would like to just start using GitHub  and sharing some of my code, 
I figured it might be a good starting point to publish my solutions 
to the coding challenge "Advent of Code" of 2019.

I think most of the puzzles are highly interesting and really get you to solve problems. 
I recommend them to everyone who is up for advancing their coding-game. 
Find it [here](https://adventofcode.com/).

For me, it is/has been a great way of exploring different fields of computer science
and working around with various Python-modules. Moreover, since all of the Problems come
with a few testcases, I also got to write my first Python unittests, which I am really happy about.

Python-modules I used so far to solve some of the problems:

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Great for working with matrices and computing stuff.
* [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/): Tool for constructing Graphs and working with them.
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): I made a video with OpenCV!
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Visualization tool.
